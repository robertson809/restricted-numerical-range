# Thesis
Senior Thesis on the interplay of the Graph Laplacian and Numerical Range. 

This code assisted in research published in Linear and Multilinear Algebra, Volume 69 2021, in the article 
"On the restricted numerical range of the Laplacian matrix for digraphs"


To see a demonstration of the Restricted Numerical Range for three regular tournament digraphs of size 5, 7 and 9, install
the necessary dependencies and run find_polygonal. 

It will afterwards continue to search for all polygonal graphs with four vertices, and report its findings after every
ten digraphs examined.
